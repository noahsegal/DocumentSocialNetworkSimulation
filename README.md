# Social Sim

Social Sim is a social file sharing network emulation software. It emulates consumers and content producers on a social network 
to discover which searching, liking and following strategies gives the consumer and producer their best results. The software
allows you to define the number of comsumer and producers, the number of tags and the different strategies to use.

## Usage

To start the program run simulation.jar and follow the simulation instructions. Ensure you have access to jfreechart-1.0.19.jar and jcommon-1.0.23.jar. http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/download.html

## Known Issues

-  Milestone 3 will add capability to get detailed info about individual Consumers and Producers in the GUI.
-  Three unused search methods are included, HipsterSearch.java, DumbSearch.java and RandomSearch.java. To be ignored for Milenstone 1 and MileStone 2.
-  Executable JAR does not currently run with external libraries. We will address this in Milestone 3 (We have been working on this for roughly 3 hours). Project still works and is runnable, but it must be set up in Eclipse.
-  To set up in Eclipse: right click on the project, click Properties, then click on Java Build Path, then click Add External JAR button. Then, please add jcommon and jfreechar, which are provided.
